#   **Family-Space**

## Introduction: 
### Objective

This is an individual project in order to meet the SFIA requirements. The objective of this project is as follows: 

"To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training." 

The concepts gained from this project is as follows: 
- Project management (Specifically the agile methodology)
- Python coding and testing
- The use of GitHub
- Basic Linux
- Python Web Development using the Flask framework
- Continuous integration with Jenkins
- Understanding and utilising Cloud concepts using GCP


### My project proposol 
I decided to make a family blog website, called Family-Space. The idea behind this project is to allow family members to connect
with each other online. Esentially a social media website just for you and your loved ones. In this web application,
users will be able to create accounts and create notes (inspiration behind the name notes is the notes stuck magnetically on the fridge).
Users will also be able to change their account name as well as delete their accounts and notes.  

## Software Design
### ERD
Originally, I wanted to add more complexity to the project by integrating a many to many relationship by adding comments as shown below in the first ERD. However, due to the added difficulty, I decided to take a more simpler approach to first meet the project specifications, this is shown in the second ERD image. The extra functonality may be added in a future sprint.
