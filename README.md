#   **Family-Space**

## Introduction: 
### Objective

This is an individual project in order to meet the SFIA requirements. The objective of this project is as follows: 

> "To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training." 

The concepts gained from this project is as follows: 
- Project management (Specifically the agile methodology)
- Python coding and testing
- The use of GitHub
- Basic Linux
- Python Web Development using the Flask framework
- Continuous integration with Jenkins
- Understanding and utilising Cloud concepts using GCP


### My project proposol 
The project idea that I decided to go with is a family blog website, titled: Family-Space. The idea behind this project is to create an online social hub for familiy members, similar to say a family Whatsapp group chat. In Family-Space, members will be able to create user accounts and make posts for everyone else to see. For the CRUD functionality aspect, a member would be able to create a user which will be saved on the database and can then update their account names if need be, this will update their information on the database. Users will also be able to create posts which will be stored on the database. Each user can also create posts which will be stored on the database and can be viewed by other users on their main page. Each user can also delete any of their posts whenever they wish, which will be wiped off the database. And finally, each user can delete their own accounts, which will subsequently wipe out all their posts.

## Software Design
### ERD
Originally, I wanted to add more complexity to the project by integrating a many to many relationship by adding comments as shown below in the first ERD. However, due to the added difficulty, I decided to take a more simpler approach to first meet the project specifications, this is shown in the second ERD image. The extra functonality may be added in a future sprint.
